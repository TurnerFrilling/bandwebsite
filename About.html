            <div class="cell">Prior to the formation of the band, Geordie Greep had separate jam sessions with Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin and Morgan Simpson, all of whom (alongside Cameron Picton) were attending BRIT School. Simpson was an accomplished drummer, winning the “Young Drummer of the Year” award in 2014. In 2016 Greep and Kwasniewski-Kelvin enlisted Simpson to form a band, with Greep and Kelvin on guitar and vocals, and with Simpson on drums. Picton joined later, on bass guitar, to complete the line-up. The band played their first gig at Brixton’s The Windmill on 12 June 2017, and would later go on to have a residency at the venue.</div>

            <div class="cell small-6">On 8 June 2018, the group released their debut single titled “Bmbmbm” released on producer Dan Carey’s record label Speedy Wunderground. On 26 September 2018, a cassette was released featuring segments of a performance with Damo Suzuki which took place on 5 May 2018 at The Windmill. On 9 November 2018, Black Midi performed five songs from their then untitled upcoming album, live at Kex Hostel in Reykjavik, Iceland, during the music festival 
                Iceland Airwaves.</div>

            <div class="cell">The eccentric performance, which was recorded for the Seattle radio station KEXP, was praised online and became popular on YouTube, exposing the band to listeners internationally. The band contributed the song “Ice Cream” featuring Jerskin Fendrix on vocals for a Brixton Hillbilly compilation album, released 7 December 
                2018. On 23 January 2019, the group released their second single, “Speedway”. 
                A 12” vinyl record was released featuring remixes by Proc Fiskal, Kwake Bass, 
                and Blanck Mass.</div>
